EXAMPLE,MCQ,"Fill in the BLANK
Which of the following is used to print on a new line?","public static void main(String[] args) { 
    BLANK (""Hello World""); 
} 
 ",System.out.println,System.println|print.out|System.printout.ln,It begins with System,you need to output to the console,
EASY,MCQ,What is the output of this code?,"public static void main(String[] args) { 
    int x = 5;
}  ",no output,5|x|args,What is happening exactly in the main function?,Try to remember how you output to the console,Code is outputted to the system using System.out.prinln. So what is happening here exactly
EASY,MCQ,What is the output of this code?,"public static void main(String[] args) { 
    int x, y;
    x = 3;
    y = 4;
   System.out.println(x*y);
}  ",12,Error|34|7,Remember what your operators are,* does multiplication,output is 3 mutiplied by 4
EASY,MCQ,What is the output of this code?,"public static void main(String[] args) { 
    int x, y;
    x = 5;
    y = 12;
   System.out.println(x%y);
}  ",2,Error|2.4|7,Remember what your operators are,% caluclates the modulus,Remember the modulus is the remainder. Eg 10%9 would give 1
EASY,MCQ,Which of the following data types can store decimal numbers?,NULL,float,int|String|boolean,Try to remember what the data types can store,"the 'int' data type only stores integer numbers i.e 1,2,3",
EASY,MCQ,What is the output of this code?,"public static void main(String[] args) { 
    int x, y;
    x = 9;
    y = 10;
   System.out.println(x+y+2);
}  ",21,xy2|192|9102,what data types are being added together?,String variables only concatenate,x and y are int variables so you just add them together
MEDIUM,MCQ,What is the output of this code?,"public static void main(String[] args) { 
    String x, y;
    x = ""abc"";
    y = ""10"";
   System.out.println(x+y);
}  ","""abc10""","xy|""abc"",""10""|Error",Remember what string concatenation is,,
MEDIUM,MISSING_LINE,"Create a variable named ""number"" with the value 7 assigned to it","public static void main(String[] args) {

}  ",int number = 7;,NULL,,,
MEDIUM,MISSING_LINE,"Create a variable named ""vehicle"" with and assign ""car"" to it","public static void main(String[] args) { 
   // COMPLETE THIS LINE

}  ",8,Error|15|53,,,
HARD,CODING,"Write a program with a variable named ""x"" with value 7, and a variable ""y"" with value 5. Then multiply them together and store the result in a variable named ""z"".",x|y|z,"int x = 7;
int y = 5;
int z = x*y;",NULL,,,
